*Staffan Canback (March 1997): Critique of Thesis “Transaction Cost Theory and Just-in-Time Manufacturing: A New Look at Vertical Integration in the United States Automobile Market” by T.H. Klier (1993), Michigan State University*

## 1) Purpose, context, and overall assessment

Canback’s document is a structured doctoral-level critique of Thomas Helmut Klier’s PhD thesis on how Just-in-Time (JIT) manufacturing reshaped governance structures—specifically vertical integration—in the US automobile industry, interpreted through Transaction Cost Economics (TCE). Canback selected the thesis because it directly overlaps with his own doctoral interests: (1) applying TCE to explain organizational boundaries and scale disadvantages, (2) operationalizing transaction costs empirically, and (3) using similar econometric techniques such as binomial and ordered probit models.

Overall, Canback judges Klier’s thesis to be concise, well-structured, and thoughtful, and emphasizes that it makes a genuine contribution because it is among the first explicit analyses linking the adoption of JIT to changes in vertical integration and buyer–supplier governance.

The critique is not adversarial; instead it is a balanced academic review: strong positive evaluation of problem framing, literature review discipline, and method choice—combined with pointed criticisms on theoretical completeness, operational challenges, and statistical limitations (especially sample size).

## 2) Klier’s core argument (as presented and evaluated)

The central claim of Klier’s thesis (as Canback summarizes it) is that JIT shifts production toward closer coordination, requiring increased mutual commitment between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and suppliers. That increased commitment leads to a form of “quasi-integration”—long-term cooperative relationships between legally separate firms—displacing the older Fordist pattern of arm’s-length contracting, while also reducing the need for full ownership integration.

In other words: JIT changes the economics of contracting and coordination. Because the production system becomes tightly interdependent, the “governance solution” moves toward hybrid arrangements (neither pure market nor full hierarchy).

A major contribution Canback highlights is Klier’s serious attempt to tackle a chronic weakness in TCE research: the difficulty of operationalizing transaction-cost concepts and conducting clean empirical tests. Canback explicitly praises Klier for adding useful empirics and serving as a model for similar future studies.

## 3) Problem formulation and hypotheses: strengths and critique
Strengths

Canback views Klier’s problem definition as both important and researchable. The thesis asks whether JIT changed vertical relationships in the US auto industry, and translates this into a testable hypothesis in TCE terms.

Canback argues that the timing and setting make the question particularly strong: the automotive sector in the 1980s underwent major transformations in supplier relations (information sharing, quality emphasis, longer contracts). These changes invite an explanation grounded in asset specificity and governance—classic TCE territory.

Klier’s hypothesis (as quoted in the critique)

Klier’s logic: mutual commitment reduces opportunism, making hold-up threats less credible and allowing more contracts to become self-enforcing; therefore mutual commitment should reduce vertical integration.

Canback endorses the clarity and narrowness of the hypothesis but adds an important clarification: a decline in vertical integration does not necessarily mean a rise in pure market contracting; instead, per Klier’s theory, both vertical integration and arm’s-length transactions decline, replaced by quasi-integration.

This is one of Canback’s key contributions as critic: he forces the governance categories to be interpreted correctly, preventing a common misreading.

## 4) Theoretical linkage: what works, what is missing

Canback says Klier’s hypothesis is well anchored in Williamson’s framework and supplemented with additional sources to support the expected outcomes.

However, his most significant negative criticism is that Klier accepts key Williamsonian predictions too uncritically—especially the idea that greater uncertainty leads to more vertical integration. Canback notes this may contradict observed reality: the auto market became more turbulent, yet vertical integration decreased.

He strengthens the critique by citing competing findings: scholars such as Balakrishnan & Wernerfelt, Walker & Weber, and Mahoney present arguments (and evidence) that uncertainty can reduce vertical integration, because firms avoid committing to specialized assets under uncertain technological conditions.

Canback’s critique is constructive rather than destructive: he proposes that “uncertainty” itself may be multidimensional (e.g., volatility vs. variety uncertainty), and that ambiguity about uncertainty types can create apparent contradictions in TCE predictions.

## 5) Literature review: high quality, but narrow theoretical scope

Canback praises the literature review as thorough and to the point, covering JIT and transaction cost theory appropriately.

Yet he flags a limitation: the review does not fully acknowledge alternative theoretical approaches beyond the transaction-cost paradigm.

This is an important critique because governance shifts in supply chains can also be explained through other lenses (capabilities, relational contracting, strategic management, institutional/industrial relations)—and ignoring these risks making TCE look more universally valid than it is.

## 6) Methodology and data: careful design but constrained evidence

A consistent theme in Canback’s critique is that Klier is methodologically serious. He commends the thesis for:

- using creative comparisons to earlier research,

- combining prior studies with new data,

- and choosing statistical techniques carefully.

However, Canback also identifies a major limitation that prevents strong inference: low questionnaire response rate and a small sample. This makes it hard to draw unambiguous conclusions, even if the model specification is defensible.

In effect, Canback argues the thesis is well designed but underpowered—leading it to be more useful as a pioneering test and inspiration than as a definitive empirical resolution.

## 7) Conclusions of the critique: value as contribution and model

- Canback’s final position is nuanced:

- Klier’s thesis advances understanding of vertical integration decisions under JIT and provides one of the first explicit transaction-cost interpretations of that shift.

- It makes TCE more “usable” by translating abstract constructs into measurable variables and empirical tests.

- The thesis is also a methodological template for other doctoral researchers.

- But limitations—especially sample size and theoretical narrowness—reduce the strength of conclusions, and key Williamsonian assumptions should have been examined more critically.

**Taken as a whole**, Canback’s critique portrays Klier’s thesis as a high-quality, pioneering piece of applied TCE research: strong conceptual framing and careful execution, producing credible directional evidence and a valuable example—while still leaving room for deeper theory comparison and stronger empirical datasets.
