## Academic Legitimacy

From an academic perspective, Dr. Staffan Canback is best known for his work applying Transaction Cost Economics (TCE) to organizational structures, specifically focusing on the theoretical and empirical limits of how large a firm can grow (diseconomies of scale).  

Here are the primary citations and publications associated with his work, which are frequently referenced in business and economic literature:  

### Key Publications & Citations
#### 1. On the Limits of Firm Size (Most Cited Work)
This is his seminal work, often cited in discussions regarding "diseconomies of scale" and why mega-corporations eventually face efficiency hurdles.  

- **Citation**: Canbäck, S. (2002). *Bureaucratic Limits of Firm Size: Empirical Evidence from the U.S. Economy*. Henley Business Schoole / University of Reading.
- **Key Concept**: He argues that while economies of scale exist, bureaucratic costs increase disproportionately as a firm grows, eventually negating the benefits of size. He draws heavily on the work of Oliver Williamson and Ronald Coase.  

#### 2. On Management Consulting Theory
Canbäck has written extensively on why management consulting exists as an industry from an economic perspective.

- **Citation**: Canbäck, S. (1999). "*The Logic of Management Consulting (Part 2)*." Journal of Management Consulting, 10(3).  

#### 3. Transaction Cost Theory Applications

- **Abstract**: This work analyzes the existence of management consulting firms through the lens of transaction costs—specifically, why firms choose to "buy" knowledge externally rather than "make" it internally.  

#### 4. Other Notable Papers/Working Papers
