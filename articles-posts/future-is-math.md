# The Future of Companies Is Math
*Dr. Staffan Canback, Tellusant*

The future of companies is math. They should have **Chief Math Officers** (CμO) who cover all aspects of math, not only AI. Yet few CEOs outside tech now anything about math. They will find it increasingly difficult to navigate the modern management landscape.  

The company I respect most is **Alphabet**. It has the math ethos and has built it since its founding in 1998. It has made countless scientific contributions including some of the most influential AI papers ever (AI started in 1946).  

#### [Google Research Publications](https://research.google/pubs/)  

At **Tellusant**, we have a long way to go to reach this exalted level, but we will get there. While many companies post photos with happy employees and cheery messages, and brag about earnings releases that are in truth not that great, we publish substance.   

We have switched to open access platforms rather than LinkedIn or Medium, emulating Alphabet (we still publish on LinkedIn, but as an afterthought.)  

Well done **Alphabet** and other scientifically, math-oriented companies like Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, and Nvidia! In the end, mathematical and technological advances are the only things that give sustainable competitive advantage.
