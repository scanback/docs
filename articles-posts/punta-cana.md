# Global Retreat in Punta Cana 2025
The Tellusant Global Retreat is held in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, this year. We have four days of work and relaxation at the ultra-luxury Live Aqua resort, a Grupo Posadas property. This follows the 2024 retreat in Panama City, Panama.  

We picked Punta Cana because it is served by direct flights from Boston, Mexico and Bogota. And having perfect weather and a turquoise ocean also helped!

Philip Burginyoung, our CEO, expertly organized the entire event. We aee all most grateful and send a big thank you!

## First Day: Welcome
The first night, we held our welcome dinner at the property's hibachi restaurant. Great for team building as we joined the chef in singing and also prepared our own food.
