# The Might of Nations

With current geopolitical tensions, it is interesting to see how the might of nations has changed over time and where we are now. I use the concept of relative market share to show the trend.

I focus on economic power instead of military power because military power without economic power is not sustainable.

I quantify this using the business concept of relative market share and applied it to countries. I think of it as relative economic might.

Relative economic might carries importance in business. It is often said that a relative market share above 2 gives an unassailable advantage from competition. I do not know if this holds for countries, but I marked it on the graph.

Over the past 20 years, the US has lost relative ground to China. This is no surprise, but the graph dimensionsonalizes the shift. It is a difficult transition for political decision makers and citizens in Washington, just as it has been for the UK and Russia.

A caveat is that relative market share may not work

Relative marketshare in business is for the largest company: 
Largest company market share / 2nd largest company marketshare

For all other companies:
Company x market share / Largest company market share. 

I used GDP in PPP$ terms for countries for 1920-2025 (1920 chosen after a period of stabilization following World War 1 and being when the British Empire was at its maximum).

I included colonies of the UK and US for relevant years. I used the Soviet Union till 1991 and Russia thereafter. india is included from independence.
