# The Might of Nations

With current geopolitical tensions, it is interesting to see how the might of nations has changed over time and where we are now. I use the concept of relative market share to show the trend.

I focus on economic power instead of military power because military power without economic power is not sustainable.

I quantify this using the business concept of relative market share and applied it to countries. I think of it as relative economic might.

Over the past 20 years, the US has lost relative ground to China. This is no surprise, but the graph dimensionsonalizes the shift. It is a difficult transition for political decision makers and citizens in Washington, just as it has been for the UK and Russia.

A caveat is that relative market share may not work 

## Relative Economic Might Definiton

Relative market share in business is for the largest company: 
*RMS = Largest company market share / 2nd largest company marketshare*

For all other companies:
*RMS = Company x market share / Largest company market share*

Similary, relative economic might is for the largest country:
*REM = Largest country GDP / 2nd largest country GDP*

For all other countries:
*REM = Country x GDP / Largest country GDP*

After calculating this, REM is Möbius-transformed so that is symmetrical around 1. That is, REM be between 0 and 2.  
*REM transformed = 2 ∙ REM untransformed / (1+REM untransformed)* Möbius[0,2,1,1]

Why do I have to make this so complicated? To get it right. If REM can go from 0 to infinity (possible without transfromation), values above 1 are exaggerated. You want to have the same upside as downside. This is a problem common in math, physics, as well as in economics. Hence the Möbius transform that rectifies this.¹



I used GDP in PPP$ terms for countries for 1920-2025 (1920 chosen after a period of stabilization following World War 1 and being when the British Empire was at its maximum).

I included colonies of the UK and US for relevant years. I used the Soviet Union till 1991 and Russia thereafter. india is included from independence.

¹ Note that consultants should also use this transfrom when discussing relative market share with clients.


I first published this analysis in 2017 and have now updated it till 2025.
