# The Might of Nations

With current geopolitical tensions in eastern Europe, around China, and in the middle east, it is interesting to see how the power of nations has changed and where we are now. 

I focus on economic power instead of military power, because military power without economic power is not sustainable.

I quantify this using the business concept of relative market share and applied it to countries.

Relative market share carries importance in business. It is often said that a relative market share above 2 gives an unassailable advantage from competition. I do not know if this holds for countries, but I marked it on the graph.

Over the past 20 years, the US has lost relative ground to Chima. This is no surprise, but the graph dimensionlizes the shift. It is a difficult transition for decision makers in Washington, just as it has been for the UK and Russia.Alliances can help alleviate this.

Relative marketshare in business is for the largest company: 
Largest company market share / 2nd largest company marketshare

For all other companies:
Company x market share / Largest company market share. 

I used GDP in PPP$ terms for countries for 1920-2025 (1920 chosen after a period of stabilization following World War 1 and being when the British Empire was at its maximum).

I included colonies of the UK and US for relevant years. I used the Soviet Union till 1991 and Russia thereafter. india is included from independence.

I first published this analysis in 2017 and have now updated it till 2025.
