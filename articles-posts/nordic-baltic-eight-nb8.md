# The Emerging Significance of the Nordic-Baltic Eight
The NB8 region is tightly integrated economically and politically and has a GDP almost of Italy's size. The total population is around 35 million and given the high standard of living, it ranks fourth in the Single Market (EU + 4) by GDP, ahead of Spain and just behind Italy at third.

It is tightly integrated economically. For example, the top countries Sweden exports to are, in terms of share of those countries' imports, the other seven NB8 countries.

It is therefore an important market for any company that wants to succeed in Europe. This is compounded by the fact that it is the most inventive region in Europe, as well as its people having a propensity to try new products and services. A European California in some sense. So non-NB8 CEOs and management teams, take notice when you develop strategies.
