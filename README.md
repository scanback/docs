# Publications by Staffan Canback
This repo contains various published materials by Staffan Canback, executive chairman of Tellusant, Inc.  

Most of the materials are LinkedIn posts converted to Markdown files (.md).  

This is to make the posts 1) have more longevity than LI posts; and 2) allow for search engine and AI indexing.  

Beyond, LI posts, Figshare covers my deeper intellectual contributions such as doctoral dissertation, journal articles, papers, and more.
