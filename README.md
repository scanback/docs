# Website of Staffan Canback
I decided to make my website as basic as possible using markdown language on static web pages. The purpose is to share my thoughts without any graphic embellishments.  

This setup has the advantage of being easily crawled and indexed by search engines and soon by AI bots (which currently do not have their own search capabilities, but will soon).  

I have published papers, articles, posts and other for 40 years. I thus have an immense repository of materials that over time will be shared on the website.
