#### [Staffan Canback (1991): *Of Coase and Chaos: A Personal Perspective on the Decreasing Management Challenge.* McKinsey & Company](Staffan-Canback-Of-Coase-and-Chaos-A-Personal-Perspective-on-the-Decreasing-Management-Challenge.pdf)
This presentation made me globally famous for a short period in the early 1990s. I was then a partner at McKinsey which gave me unparalled reach.

I then stopped giving it because of what I perceived as potential copyright issues with the Winnie-the-Pooh images. If there were real issues, they havee now expired. Thus, I post the deck for the first time in 35 years.

The presentation combines Coasian Transaction Cost Economics, with chaos theory, and an adaption of Henri Fayol's management theory (he was the first person to articulate what management is, more than 100 years ago).

I find some of the thinking dated but will not update the deck since the first attempt invariably is the best. Most of my conclusions still hold though.
