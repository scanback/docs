#### [Data Unification Methods](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Data-Unification-Methods.pdf)  
Effective data unification is key to corporate performance and represnts a significant profit and growth potential. However, most firms do not realize this and delegate these efforts, if any exist, to low-level employees.

#### [China Geographic Breakdown](Tellusant-Quick-Read-China-Geographic-Breakdown.pdf)  
Tellusant covers China with income distribution and other metrics at a detailed level. China’s 1st level subdivisions are the 31 provinces and equivalent units. However, the average province has a population of 45 million people. Too many for good analyses and insights. We therefore work at the 2nd level subdivisions with 343 entities.  
#### [What Is Our Competitive Set? The Pepsi Example](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Competitive-Set-Pepsi-Example.pdf)  
Who do we compete with? We use the Pepsi brand to expand the definition from the obvious to the sublime. We divide the reasoning into a qualitative example and a mathematical theory.  
#### [Corporate Renewal](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Corporate-Renewal.pdf)  
Nothing is forever, not even giant companies. It is well known that companies grow, plateau, and fade or disappear. In the short term, the Fortune top 10 US companies in 2022 saw seven new entrants and seven exits compared to 2012. This is not unique to the tech era. Churn is the norm decade after decade.  
#### [Defining and Quantifying Socioeconomic Levels](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Socioeconomic-Levels.pdf)  
The middle class is often talked about but seldom well defined. Before we embark on an exposé on trends, we therefore define socioeconomic levels—what we call the ‘Income Level Standard’. We then show trends.  
#### [Developing Subnational Strategies](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Subnational-Strategies.pdf)

#### [Effective Decision Making](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Effective-Decision-Making.pdf)  
Companies are often described as decision factories. Based on the academic literature and extensive interviews, we created this decision-making framework that can be used to organize the strategic management process, and more.  
#### [Fruhan’s Markers for Corporate Success](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Fruhan-Success-Markers.pdf)  
How do we evaluate whether a company is successful? There are many frameworks but let us draw attention to our chairman’s Harvard Business School professor William Fruhan’s markers of success, from his brilliant book ‘Financial Strategy’.  
#### [How The Engel Curve Shapes Global Food Spending](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Engel-Curve.pdf)  
Ernst Engel, a German economist and statistician, published what is now known as the Engel curve in 1857. He found that as household’s income increased, the share of the income spent on food decreased.  
#### [Income Elasticity—The Global Beer Example](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Income-Elasticity-Beer-Example.pdf)  
How does demand for a category or industry change with disposable income and how do you go from analysis to strategic implications? We use global beer demand to illustrate.

#### [Predicting Exchange Rates](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Exchange-Rate-Predictions.pdf)  
How can we estimate future exchange rates (XR) for strategic purposes (3-10 years out)? The answer is that a random walk model does the best job. Understanding the logic of future XR may seem difficult, but it is not. We tend to make it difficult though.  
#### [Predicting Is not Forecasting](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Predicting-Versus-Forecasting.pdf)  
Creating a forecast is only one part of prediction. We illustrate with an example of how a country’s market for a category will evolve.
#### [Tellusant’s Water Intake Calculator](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Water-Intake-Calculator.pdf)  
We often work with beverages companies, covering categories from bottled water to wine. A fundamental metric to understand when analyzing market growth is how much water the human body needs.
#### [The City Middle Class Compared to Country GDP Growth](Tellusant-Quick-Read-City-Middle-Class.pdf) 
Cities typically grow faster than their countries in emerging markets, and the middle class (and above) grows even faster. We took the ten largest cities in Latin America to illustrate the point.  
#### [The Global Middle Class](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Global-Middle-Class.pdf)

#### [Unbundling Demand Drivers Using Path Diagrams](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Path-Diagrams.pdf)  
Household income is the most important driver of demand for almost all categories globally. It is so overwhelmingly important that other demand drivers seemingly pale in comparison. However, this is only partially true. Path diagrams explain why.  
#### [Using the Correct Macro Metrics: Avoid GDP per Capita](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Correct-Macro-Metrics.pdf)  
It is bad practice to evaluate consumer goods markets based on gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Why should GDP have anything to do with consumer demand?
#### [The Furst Food Choice Framework](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Furst-Food-Choice-Framework.pdf)
Tellusant applies Tanis Furst’s food choice framework when trying to understand consumer behavior. We use it to design consumer surveys, to specify statistical analysis, and to have informed discussions.  
#### [The Four Sources of Corporate Profits](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Makadok-Four-Profit-Sources.pdf)

#### [The Risk of Nations](Tellusant-Quick-Read-Risk-of-Nations.pdf)  
How should we look at country risk? We present the risk of nations based on a quantitative analysis. We divide risk into financial and market (demand) components. Looking at risk this way gives a strict definition to what is meant by risk. It is in line with Frank Knight’s observation: Risk is a knowable probability distribution.  
#### [How Much Is Spent on Marketing in the U.S.?](Tellusant-Quick-Read-US-Marketing-Spend.pdf)  
Surprisingly, marketing spend is not a widely tracked metric. As part of building a model for the cost of forecasting errors, we needed this, R&D spend, and capex. Therefore, data were collected for large U.S. companies, one by one.
