# SCANBACK *think*

This personal website will contain my published works. They range from scientific papers to social media posts.  

Why **SCANBACK** ***think***? It's drawn from George Orwell's *Newspeak* in **1984**. *Newspeak* was aimed at dumbing down people's critical thinking, so it's ill chosen by me, but it has an aesthetic beauty with its mangled grammar that I wanted to capture. A longer title would be "Staffan Canback's thoughts on management issues".

It's being built gradually starting in October 2025. For the time being, find some of the publications on <a href="https://figshare.com/authors/Staffan_Canback/20547296" target="_blank">Figshare</a>  

#### [Articles & Posts](articles-posts/index.md)  
I have hundreds of LinkedIn and Medium articles and posts that are lost because of the ephemeral character of social media. I gradually save them for posterity here.  

#### [Academic Papers et Plus](papers/index.md)
Find my academic papers and doctoral dissertation. They covers diseconpmies of scale / bureaucratic limits of firm size, the theory of why management consyultants exist, global market analyses, new perspectives on what strategy is, and more.
